  I am an assistant professor of [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) 
  at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/).

  I work on systems. I build systems that enable
  users to verify their outsourced services.
  In particular, my current research includes:

  * verifying the execution of applications on untrusted servers,
  * verifying behaviors of black-box databases,
  * verifying neural networks for systems.

  If you are interested in building systems, we should talk (c.tan@northeastern.edu).

  Please find my CV [here](doc/info/cv.pdf).

## About me

Before joining Northeastern, I got my Ph.D. from [Courant Institute](https://cims.nyu.edu/) [NYU](http://www.nyu.edu)
advised by [Michael Walfish](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mwalfish/),
and my M.S. and B.E.
from [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) and
[Nanjing University](http://www.nju.edu.cn/html/eng/1.html), respectively.
<!--all in Computer Software Engineering.-->

I was a student at [NYU Systems Group](http://news.cs.nyu.edu/).
Before that, I was at [IPADS](http://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/) and advised by
[Binyu Zang](http://ppi.fudan.edu.cn/art/binyu_zang)
and [Haibo Chen](http://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub:members:haibo_chen),
where I did research on mobile systems and system virtualization.

I'm part of [TEEX](https://teex.io). TEEX is a secure distributed computing
platform which provides a Layer-2 solution based on blockchain.

I also worked with a group of enthusiastic and interesting guys in
Italy who were working on a startup company [WalletSaver](http://www.walletsaver.com/).
I helped build the first version of their mobile app on Android.
