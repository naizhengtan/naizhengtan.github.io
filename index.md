## About me

Before joining NYU, I got my Master degree from [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/)
and Bachelor degree from [Nanjing University](http://www.nju.edu.cn/html/eng/1.html).

I was a student at [IPADS](http://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/) group and advised by
[Binyu Zang](http://ppi.fudan.edu.cn/art/binyu_zang)
and [Haibo Chen](http://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub:members:haibo_chen),
where I did research on mobile system and system virtualization.

I'm part of a startup company [TEEX](https://teex.io). TEEX is a secure
distributed computing platform which provides a Layer-2 solution based on
blockchain.

I also worked with a group of enthusiastic and interesting guys in
Italy who were working on a startup company [WalletSaver](http://www.walletsaver.com/).
I helped build the first version of their mobile app on Android.
