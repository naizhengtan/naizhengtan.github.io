  I am a final year Ph.D. student in [Systems Group](http://news.cs.nyu.edu/)
  at [Courant Institute](https://cims.nyu.edu/) [NYU](www.nyu.edu),
  advised by [Michael Walfish](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mwalfish/).

  I work on system security. I build systems that enable
  users to verify their outsourced services.
  In particular, my research includes:

  * verifying the execution of applications on untrusted servers,
  * verifying serializability of black-box databases,
  * localizing failures of data center networks.

  Please find my CV [here](doc/info/cv.pdf).

## About me

Before joining NYU, I got my M.S. from [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/)
and B.E. from [Nanjing University](http://www.nju.edu.cn/html/eng/1.html),
both in Computer Software Engineering.

I was a student at [IPADS](http://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/) group and advised by
[Binyu Zang](http://ppi.fudan.edu.cn/art/binyu_zang)
and [Haibo Chen](http://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub:members:haibo_chen),
where I did research on mobile system and system virtualization.

I'm part of [TEEX](https://teex.io). TEEX is a secure distributed computing
platform which provides a Layer-2 solution based on blockchain.

I also worked with a group of enthusiastic and interesting guys in
Italy who were working on a startup company [WalletSaver](http://www.walletsaver.com/).
I helped build the first version of their mobile app on Android.
